Hello everyone!
My name is Andrea Donati and I am passionate about Machine Learning and AI in general. My favourite fields at the moment are Text to Speech, Reinforcement Learning and Finance, and I like to mix between them :)

I'm currently a Deep Learning Engineer at Translated, in Rome. Translated is an Italian translation company founded and based in Rome, where we use Machine Learning and AI to help humans to better do their jobs!
In translation, Machine Learning saves a lot of time to professional translators by suggesting a possible translation that can be accepted or edited. In this way the translator can focus his time on more important tasks like style and customization of the translation.

### More Information

When I don't work or study I like almost every outdoor activity like snowboarding, sailing, hiking.
In particular in the last year I fell in love with climbing! :D
